# Fraud Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of financial transactions to identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, it uncovers key characteristics of transactions that may help in detecting fraud.

## Dataset

The dataset includes transaction records with the following key features:

- **type**: Type of transaction (e.g., CASH-IN, TRANSFER).
- **amount**: Amount involved in the transaction.
- **isFraud**: A binary label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Usage

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Inspection**: The notebook provides information on dataset structure, summary statistics, and checks for missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations such as count plots and distribution plots help in examining transaction types and amounts, particularly for identifying fraud indicators.

## Files

- **ML_INNOVATIVE_ASSIGNMENT.ipynb**: The main notebook containing all code for data loading, inspection, EDA, and visualization.
